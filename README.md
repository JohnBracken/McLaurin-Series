# McLaurin Series

This is a script to calculate natural log and exponential functions using 
a McLaurin power series from calculus.  It takes user input for the value
at which to evaulate a function and the number of iterations for the power
series. Comparisons are also made between the outputs of the power series
functions and the equivalent functions that are actually built into the 
C++ math library.
